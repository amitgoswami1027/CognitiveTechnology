# A GENTLE INTRODUCTION TO SOAR - AN ARCHITECTURE FOR HUMAN COGNITION: 2006

### 1. INTRODUCTION 
Many Disciplines contribute to the field of Cognitive Science that include psychology, linguistics,anthropology, and artificial intelligence.

COGNITIVE PHENOMENA - phenomena like problem solving, decision making,language, memory, and learning.

### 2. IDEA OF ARCHITECTURE
Unified theories of cognition (UTCs) - unified theory of cognition means trying to find a set of computationally-realizable mechanisms and structures that can answer all the questions we might want to ask about cognitive behavior. A key piece of
the puzzle, we believe, lies in the idea of architecture.
* BEHAVIOR = ARCHITECTURE + CONTENT
Using this idea, we can define a cognitive architecture as a theory of the fixed mechanisms and structures that underlie
human cognition. Factoring out what is common across cognitive behaviors across the phenomena explained by microtheories, seems to us to be a significant step toward producing a unified theory of cognition.

### 3. WHAT COGNITIVE BEHAVIORS HAVE IN COMMON
What sort of behaviour should we model in SOAR Architecutre. A cognitive architecture must help produce cognitive behavior. Reading certainly requires cognitive ability. So does solving equations, cooking dinner, driving a car,telling a joke, or playing baseball. In fact, most of our everyday behavior seems to require some degree of thinking to mediate our perceptions and actions. 
Because every architecture is a theory about what is common to the content it processes, Soar is a theory of what cognitive behaviors have in common. In particular SOAR theory posits that cognitive behaviour has at least the following characteristics:

#### 1. It is Goal Oriented. 
#### 2. It takes place in a rich, complex, detailed environment
#### 3. It requires a large amount of knowledge
#### 4. It requires the use of symbols and abstractions
#### 5. It is flexible, and a function of the environment
#### 6. It requires learning from the environment and experience

# BEHAVIOR = ARCHITECTURE + CONTENT

How can we express the different kinds of knowledge the model must have so that it acts in a goal oriented way?representing the knowledge in terms of goals, states, and operators and guiding the choice of which operator to apply by the principle of rationality. 

### 4. BEHAVIOUR AS A MOVEMENT THROUGH PROBLEM SPACES
What knowledge becomes part of the state and what knowledge becomes part of the operators? How do we know what an operator application will do? How do we know when the goal has been achieved? To answer these questions, the next section describes how Soar supports goals, problem spaces, states and operators.
 
### 5. TYING THE CONTENT TO THE ARCHITECTURE
