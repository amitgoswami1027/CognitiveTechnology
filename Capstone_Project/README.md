## SOAR COURSE - CAPSTONE PROJECT
To complete the course, we will introduce the final project: 2048. Before the dive into the technical details, we'll provide an overview of the game:
• The gameboard consists of a 4 X 4 grid. Each cell in the grid can hold a number in the order of 2^x.
• The gameboard starts by adding two '2' values randomly to the board.
• The you have the option of moving in four directions: Up, Down, Left, Right. When you move a given direction, blocks of like value combine (and double). Two '2' values combine into '4'. All whitespace gets shifted so that the blocks are as far towards the direction as possible. During every move, a '2' is placed in a blank space randomly on the board.
• You win the game by obtaining 2048, or lose it by filling up the gameboard to the point where no blocks can be combined
Give the game a shot if you have never played it.
