## COGNITIVE TECHNOLOGY- SOAR
### PROJECT02

For this project, you will encode many of pieces learned in this section. You will write a simple agent that examines a user's 
bank account and adds a value based on the amount. Once the account hits a specified amount, it prints a message. Start by 
adding the following two rules to a new Soar file: Specifications.

Specifications: • Use dot notation to reference the value at Bank.AccountBalance • If the AccountBalance >= 1000, add 4000 • If 
the AccountBalance < 1000, add 5000 • Once the AccountBalance >= 5000, print 'Balance over five thousand' Hints: • To 
accomplish the three initial comparisons, two operators will likely be necessary • Be sure to encode a variable for the rules 
to retract, or the selected operator (for any of the rules) will exist.
